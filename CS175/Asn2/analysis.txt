a) The lower order terms are ignored, so this function is quadratic: O(n^2).
b) This would be 70n, and the coefficients are ignored, so the function is linear: O(n).
c) The lower order terms and the coefficient are ignored, so this function is log linear: O(nlogn).
d) The lower order terms and the coefficient are ignored, so this function is quadratic: O(n^2).
e) The lower order terms and the coefficient are ignored, so this function is exponential: O(a^n).
f) The lower order term is ignored, so this function is linear: O(n).
g) The lower order terms are ignored, so this function is log linear: O(nlogn).

4.7
a) Regardless of the input, the loop will be executed once for every element of n, 
so the function is O(n) for the best and worst cases.

b) Since i is divided by 2 on every iteration of the loop, which happens 
regardless of the type of input, this function is O(logn) for the best and worst cases.

c) Regardless of the type of input, this function would be n * (1/3n + 1/6n + 1/3). 
Because lower order terms and constants are ignored, this function is O(n^2) for the best and worst cases.
