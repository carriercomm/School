Reads each line in a file given as an argument, identifies
which of 9 types the line belongs to, and executes the
appropriate action based on the line type.
Some lines trigger a command to be sent through a pipe to 
Sketchpad.jar, which must be in the working directory.

Compile by typing: 
make
 
Run by typing: 
./draw2 ./input_file
where "input_file" is the text file you wish to use.
Ensure that draw2 and the input file are in your
working directory.

Delete the executable and all .o files by typing:
make clean
