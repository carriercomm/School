To compile the server emulator, I followed the guide at __, which I have copied and 
pasted here (omitting irrelevant information):



Unfortunately, I found that I could only compile it on Ubuntu 11.10 32bit.
Using 12.10 will compile all of the executables except for the LoginServer, and using
64bit will result in multiple compilation errors (which were fairly easy to fix, but
from what I've heard the emulator doesn't run on it very well, so I don't recommend it).

For the EverQuest client, I'm not sure how you want to do this. Either I can lend you
my client to install (must be on Windows), or we can arrange a meeting where I
bring my laptop with EverQuest installed and you can connect to the server that you've
compiled with this code.

For evaluating my code, go to the eqemu/source/EQEmulator/zone directory.
As mentioned in the report, you can use grep (or whatever
you prefer) to find my contributions by searching for "#ifdef TUPES_AI".
The majority of my code is in npc.cpp (and the corresponding npc.h), with some
in MobAI.cpp. 
Although the total amount of my code is not large, please keep in mind the amount
of time and work that went in to reading the (mostly undocumented) existing source 
code, in order to figure out exactly where to insert my code and which functions to use.

*** Optional ***
One thing to keep in mind is that my new AI code is only for animal NPCs. This means
that if you keep the database as is, there will some animals controlled by my code
intermixed with a bunch of NPCs controlled by the (dumb) existing AI code.
This can be interesting, but if you want to just have my AI controlled NPCs, you can
execute the following SQL statement to the MySQL database:
DELETE FROM npc_types WHERE bodytype <> 21

*** Becoming a GM and using GM commands ***
For evaluating the animal AI, it might be useful for you to raise your status
in the accounts table in the database. By setting your status to 250, you can use
GM commands by hitting enter (which allows you to write in the message box area)
and then entering in the command. Some of the most useful commands for me have
been:

#invulnerable on	// so you don't have to worry about dying
#zone southkarana	// takes you to a zone with lots of animals, other possibilites
				// include northkarana, westkarana, and eastkarana
#gmspeed on		// for moving VERY fast (not realistic if testing user experience)
#time 12			// for when it's dark, this will make it noon
#kill				// for killing the targeted NPC
#heal			// for healing the targeted NPC
#size <some_int>	// for changing the size of target, normal values are around 3-10
